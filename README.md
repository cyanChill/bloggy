# cyanBlog

This is a project to practice the Jamstack. Here, we have a folder for the backend and folders for the frontend (for client and admin uses).

- Clients/users are able to post comments without signing up on public posts.
- Admins can add/update/delete posts (also unpublish them).
- Admins can also delete comments.
